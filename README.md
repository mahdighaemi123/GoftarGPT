# GoftarGPT Telegram Bot üó£Ô∏èü§ñ

A powerful and responsive Telegram bot that leverages AI for advanced audio processing. It can seamlessly transcribe voice messages into text and convert text messages back into high-quality speech. The bot includes a simple VIP system to manage user access.

This bot is built using Python with `asyncio` for high performance and relies on an OpenAI-compatible API for its AI capabilities.

## ‚ú® Features

  * üé§ **Speech-to-Text**: Send or forward any voice message, and the bot will instantly reply with the transcribed text.
  * ‚úçÔ∏è **Text-to-Speech**: Send a text message, and the bot will generate a high-quality voice message in response using a modern TTS model.
  * üîê **VIP Access Control**: The bot is private by default. Only users who provide a secret VIP code can access its core features.
  * üíæ **Persistent Storage**: VIP user lists and the bot's progress are saved locally to JSON files, ensuring data persists across restarts.
  * üìù **Comprehensive Logging**: All important events are logged to both the console and a file (`data/bot.log`) for easy debugging and monitoring.
  * üöÄ **Asynchronous**: Built with `asyncio` to handle multiple user requests concurrently without blocking.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get your own instance of the bot up and running.

### 1\. Prerequisites

  * **Python 3.8+**
  * A **Telegram Bot Token**. You can get one from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.
  * An **API Key** from an OpenAI-compatible service that provides audio endpoints (like MetisAI, as configured, or OpenAI itself).

### 2\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/VoiceGPT-Telegram-Bot.git
cd VoiceGPT-Telegram-Bot
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You'll need a `requirements.txt` file:

```txt
# requirements.txt
python-telegram-bot
httpx
python-dotenv
```

### 4\. Configure Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project and add your credentials.

```dotenv
# .env file

# Get this from @BotFather on Telegram
BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"

# Your API key for the audio processing service
METIS_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

# A secret code for users to gain VIP access
VIP_CODE="SUPER_SECRET_CODE_123"
```

### 5\. Run the Bot

Once the dependencies are installed and the `.env` file is configured, you can start the bot:

```bash
python bot.py
```

The bot will create a `data/` directory automatically to store logs and state files. You should see a log message in your console confirming that the bot is running.

-----

## üöÄ Usage

1.  **Start a chat** with your bot on Telegram.
2.  The bot will initially restrict access. **Send the `VIP_CODE`** that you defined in your `.env` file.
3.  The bot will confirm your VIP status. You can now use its features:
      * **To get text from a voice message**: Record and send a voice note, or forward one from another chat.
      * **To get a voice message from text**: Simply type and send any text message.
